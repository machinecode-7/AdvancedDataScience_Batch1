# Question 1
# Problem statement: We are running a bus service, if any customer asks for a ticket, we will ask them their age
# since price of ticket is based on their age and will give them the ticket
# so input from user is age, and output we need to provide is the price of the ticket.

# Create a module and import it in your main script:
# Take the age and return the price of the ticket for that person
    # for eg: 
    # if age <= 13 return 30$
    #if age >=50  return 30$
    # else return 60$

#ps: In a nutshell, half price for kids and senior citizen compared to adults.

#Question 2
# Follow module structure for this program as well
# create a module to multiply each value of one list with each value of second list
# and store all these values in a new list (can use append)
# so basically inputs to the function are two list, let's say list1 and list 2
# for eg:
# list1 = [1,2]
#list2 = [3,4]
# desired output:
# 1*3 = 3
# 1*4 = 4
# 2*3 = 6
# 2*4 = 8
# output_list = [3,4,6,8]
